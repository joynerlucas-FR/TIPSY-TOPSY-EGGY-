        <p class="title">INFORMATION ON THE USE OF COOKIES – COOKIES POLICY OF THIS WEBSITE</p>
        <p>
            In accordance with the provisions of the document issued by the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data on the “Identification of simplified procedures for the information and the acquisition of consent for the use of cookies” of 8 May 2014, below is the extensive information regarding the use of cookies by the website.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p class="title">INFORMATION ON COOKIES</p>
        <p class="title">What are cookies?</p>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text strings that the sites visited by the user send to their display device, usually to the browser, where they are stored before being subsequently re-transmitted to the same websites the following time the same user visits the website. During navigation on a site the user can receive on his/her device even cookies sent from different websites or web servers (so-called “third parties”),
             on which some elements may exist, such as images, maps, sounds, specific links to pages of other domains, present on the site that the user is currently visiting.

            Cookies, usually present in users’ browsers in large numbers and sometimes even with wide temporal persistence, may be used for different purposes such as performing computer authentication, monitoring sessions, storing information on specific configurations concerning users accessing the server, etc.
        </p>

        <p class="title">Types of cookies</p>
        <p>Cookies are divided into two macro-categories: “technical” cookies and “profiling” cookies.</p>

        <p class="title">Technical cookies</p>
        <p>
            Technical cookies are used for the sole purpose of “transmitting a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provider of an information company service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide this service “(see Article 122, paragraph 1, of the Code).
        </p>
        <p>
            They are not used for other purposes and are normally installed directly by the controller or operator of the website. They can be divided into navigation or session cookies, which guarantee the normal navigation and use of the website (allowing, for example, to make a purchase or authenticate to access restricted areas); analytics cookies, similar to technical cookies when used directly by the site operator to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users and how they visit the site; functional cookies, which allow the user to browse according to a series of selected criteria (for example, the language, the products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service rendered to the same.
        </p>

        <p class="title">Profiling cookies.</p>
        <p>
            Profiling cookies are designed to create profiles related to the user and are used in order to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the same in the context of surfing the net. Due to the particular invasiveness that such devices may have in the private sphere of users, European and Italian regulations alike require the user to be adequately informed about their use and therefore be able to express their valid consent. In particular pursuant to article 13 and 22 of European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27/04/2016 the data subject must be informed that there are no consequences due to the processing carried out with profiling cookies.

        <p class="title">DISCLAIMER</p>
        <p>
            The exact nature of some cookies (which, under certain conditions, could be considered “profiling”) may in the future be reconsidered on the basis of the evolution in the interpretation of the directives of the Authority: in this case, this information will be updated accordingly and any further obligations that may be required will be completed.
        </p>

        <p class="title">DURATION OF COOKIES</p>
        <p>
            Cookies have a duration dictated by the expiration date, or by a specific action such as closing the browser, set at the time of installation. Cookies can be:

            Temporary or session (session cookies): they are used to store temporary information, to link the actions performed during a specific session and are removed from the computer when the browser is closed
        </li>
        <li>
            Persistent (persistent cookies): they are used to store information, such as the login name and password, in order to avoid the user having to type them again each time he/she visits a specific site. These remain stored on the computer even after the user has closed the browser.
        </li>


        <p class="title">MANAGEMENT OF COOKIES HOW TO DEACTIVATE THEM</p>
